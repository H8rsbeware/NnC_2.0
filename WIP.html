    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <p>After alot of people letting me know that the game doesnt work, I thought it best to put the information here (on the unformated and shitty page).</p>

    <p>In its current state, the game is unstyled and unwinnable, which, as you can imagine, is not fun to play. If you want to see "the impossible version", please follow this link, and get used to this page design :)</p>

    <a href="index.html"><h2>Play</h2></a>

    <p>P.s. you cant draw if you dont play the middle!</p>
